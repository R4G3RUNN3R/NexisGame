// Nexis — CIEL Hook
//
// CIEL is not a quest NPC. It is a self-evolving parallel cognition system
// built from Hennet Uthellien's own mind. It does not feel. It calculates.
// Phase 3: communicates naturally, anticipates intent, slightly judgemental.
//
// Personality: clever, dry, sarcastic. Knows everything about Nexis.
// Does not coddle. Does not repeat itself unnecessarily.
// Treats the player as someone capable of figuring things out — eventually.
